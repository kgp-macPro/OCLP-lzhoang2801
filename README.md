<h1>Experimental Fork of OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly</h1>
</div>

This repository contains a preserved state of **lzhoang2801's fork of OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly** (last upstream commit: Dec 24, 2025). The original upstream state from Dec 24, 2025 is not capable of successfully applying root patches on macOS Tahoe.

The failure is caused by missing AppleHDA resources inside the required PatcherSupportPkg Universal-Binaries package referenced by the patcher. Root patching fails even though the patchset itself is otherwise functional.

This repository restores a working state by allowing OCLP to access preserved resources including AppleHDA required by that patchset.

This fork is **not an official upstream release** of OpenCore Legacy Patcher and is not affiliated with the Dortania OCLP project.

This fork exclusively aims to restore modern Wi-Fi (including AirDrop and AirPlay) and modern audio (AppleHDA) on advanced Hackintosh systems running macOS 26 Tahoe.

This fork is not officially supported by the OCLP developers. It only reflects the development work already done by the original OCLP contributors.

Do **not** apply root patches on unsupported native Macs or on Hackintosh systems with unsupported hardware (e.g. GPUs). Apart from modern Wi-Fi and modern audio, other root patches are expected to fail.

This fork is intended solely for testing the development state of the upcoming OpenCore Legacy Patcher 3.0.0 with regard to modern Wi-Fi and modern audio functionality.

## AMFI / Signing notice

The distributed binaries are unsigned and therefore cannot be used together with **AMFIPass.kext**.

AMFIPass requires a properly signed OCLP release. Until an official signed release of OCLP 3.0.0 becomes available, disable AMFIPass.kext and use:

amfi=0x80

After disabling AMFI, some applications (for example Firefox) may fail to start.  
To mitigate this behavior, additionally use:

ipc_control_port_options=0

Initial testing showed stable and reliable Wi-Fi (including AirDrop and AirPlay) and AppleHDA functionality, which should satisfy the requirements of most modern Hackintosh systems.

## Important dependency

Root patching requires **PatcherSupportPkg** resources provided by this preserved mirror:

https://github.com/kgp-macPro/PatcherSupportPkg-lzhoang2801

If this repository becomes unavailable or private, required downloads will fail.

---

## What was changed here

- Redirected PatcherSupportPkg downloads to the preserved mirror containing the full Universal-Binaries.dmg (including AppleHDA)
- No root patch logic was modified

---

## Important compatibility notice

This repository is intended for **macOS Tahoe 26.3 and earlier only**.

Starting with macOS 26.4 beta 1, Apple introduced fundamental changes to the system patching workflow.  
The previous OCLP Tahoe patch method is no longer functional on these versions.

In particular:
- The previous HFS-based patch image workflow is no longer supported by the OS
- `hdiutil` mounting now requires elevated privileges
- As a result, the root patch process used by OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly and related forks cannot complete successfully

For macOS 26.4 and newer, a redesigned patcher is required.  
Users should instead use for now:

OCLP-Mod 3.1.5 (or newer)  
https://github.com/laobamac/OCLP-Mod/releases

This repository remains a preserved and reproducible reference implementation of the last working Tahoe 26.3 root patching method.
